# My Mini Project

This My Mini Project repository is a repository that contains my personal training. This repository project is my personal practice in learning web programming so that the existing projects are not too big and heavy, but the projects I work on still have a specific goal of developing other large projects or just daily personal training. Apart from being a means of practice, this repository is also used as a forum for me to share the experiences that I have gained in studying a material.

This repository is a repository that was created specifically to accommodate all my training during 2022. This is intended as my evaluation material in seeing my personal development during 2022, especially in full-stack web programming material.

## Project Movie App (15 February 2022)
<hr>

<br>
in early 2022 I started to learn API in javascript. If you look at the length of time I have studied, it can be said that I am late in learning API. This is because last year I focused on learning front-end in implementing design to websites, so I still focused on learning business and building a business. so I learned web programming as a way to fill my spare time by creating projects.

In this project, I created a simple web movie using HTML, CSS, JavaScript. In this project, I aim to understand how it works and create a simple API.

I named this web movie "Go Vie" (short for GO Movie). the reason for giving the name is because that's what crossed my head when making a website hahaha.

In making a website this time I learned to use the API with the asynchronous method in javascript. asynchronous is event-driven which means when we start an operation that we don't know when to stop, we create a callback that will be called when the operation has finished. seems to delay the program until it gets the result

in this project, I created a simple website that can provide brief information related to movies, for example, related to story synopsis and movie ratings. To make it easier to search the web, it is also equipped with colors in the assessment. If the rating is small, we will color it red, yellow for medium and green for good.

besides that, the web is also equipped with a search that can make it easier for us to find our favorite movies.

## Project Contact-App (19 March 2022)
<hr>
<br>

My project this time is a simple contacts repository. my project uses JSON as repository for additional contacts. the project is simple CRUD (Create, Read, Delete, Delete). This project was created as an exercise before learning more about databases, in this exercise, I understand the flow required to perform simple CRUD in a database. CRUD is also added with a data validation system so that data can be stored properly

Apart from that using JSON is quite appropriate because I will study the MongoDB database which is a database without SQL. Databases without SQL offer a different form of database to SQL. SQL databases are relational databases that use 'relationships' (which are usually called tables) to store data and match that data using characteristics common to each data set. whereas No-SQL has unstructured data storage and retrieval, its data has a JSON-like form. This type of database can handle a large number of databases with dynamic schemas.

## Project Web Scraping (15 May 2022)

<hr>
<br>

After stopping studying because of the midterm exams, I went back to studying web programming. this time I learned about Web scraping. web scraping is a beneficial method in online business, whether it's for market research, competitor research, or finding leads. However, the benefits go beyond that.

web scraping can "take" business competitor data as material for business evaluation. web scraping data can be used as a deep understanding of consumer needs. This helped me as an entrepreneur in analyzing competitors easily.

However, web scraping also has drawbacks, I think web scraping results in the data obtained not always being neat. This is because the data is taken from HTML, which may include unwanted data. then it is necessary to update if there are changes to the website. and one more thing, namely that several sources state that using web scraping too often can block our computer's IP so that we cannot reaccess the website.

## Project Dicoding Bootscamp (30 April 2022 - 15 May 2022)

<hr>
<br>

right after I finished my mid-semester exam, I continued my learning by attending a Bootcamp from the Indonesian tourism ministry. in Bootcamp this time I learned the basics of making a website.

even though it's very simple because Bootcamp is intended for people who have never coded the web before, I still get new knowledge. it's a nice experience to be able to know web creation from another side that hasn't been explored before.

I also invited one of my friends to participate in this Bootcamp. We learned a lot about some basic things that we might have missed because we were both self-taught. the most interesting thing was writing HTML 5 which turned out to be much more complex than some of the information I got before. then web storage is also one of my interests in continuing this project.

I have an idea to continue the project by creating web news with API by utilizing web storage in its creation. This web storage will help the web in knowing the behavior of the user when entering the website, for that, I will need the Braind.JS library to perform user data processing. it will be useful to provide relevant and suitable news for users

### Make with :

* HTML
* CSS
