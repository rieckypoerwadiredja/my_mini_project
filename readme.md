# My Mini Project

This My Mini Project repository is a repository that contains my personal training. This repository project is my personal practice in learning web programming so that the existing projects are not too big and heavy, but the projects I work on still have a specific goal of developing other large projects or just daily personal training. Apart from being a means of practice, this repository is also used as a forum for me to share the experiences that I have gained in studying a material.

This repository is a repository that was created specifically to accommodate all my training during 2022. This is intended as my evaluation material in seeing my personal development during 2022, especially in full-stack web programming material.

## Project Movie App (15 February 2022)
<hr>

<br>
in early 2022 I started to learn API in javascript. If you look at the length of time I have studied, it can be said that I am late in learning API. This is because last year I focused on learning front-end in implementing design to websites, so I still focused on learning business and building a business. so I learned web programming as a way to fill my spare time by creating projects.

In this project, I created a simple web movie using HTML, CSS, JavaScript. In this project, I aim to understand how it works and create a simple API.

I named this web movie "Go Vie" (short for GO Movie). the reason for giving the name is because that's what crossed my head when making a website hahaha.

In making a website this time I learned to use the API with the asynchronous method in javascript. asynchronous is event-driven which means when we start an operation that we don't know when to stop, we create a callback that will be called when the operation has finished. seems to delay the program until it gets the result

in this project, I created a simple website that can provide brief information related to movies, for example, related to story synopsis and movie ratings. To make it easier to search the web, it is also equipped with colors in the assessment. If the rating is small, we will color it red, yellow for medium and green for good.

besides that, the web is also equipped with a search that can make it easier for us to find our favorite movies.

You can see the website at [GoVie](https://govie.netlify.app/)
